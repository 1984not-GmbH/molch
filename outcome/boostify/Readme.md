Build and tests passing: Linux [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ned14/boost-outcome.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ned14/boost-outcome)

Herein lies the Boost-ified edition of standalone https://github.com/ned14/outcome.
This repo is generated by **script** and thus any changes made here will get eaten!

Installation into an older Boost and running the test suite:

```
cd boost/libs
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ned14/boost-outcome.git outcome
cd ..
./b2 headers
./b2 libs/outcome/test cxxflags=--std=c++14
```

Todo:
- [x] Write script suitable for cronjob conversion of standalone Outcome
directory structure to Boost one.
- [x] Write regex based find and replace in files.
- [x] Write Jamfile for test suite.
- [x] Rewrite config.hpp to use Boost instead of QuickCppLib.
- [x] Raise on Travis and Appveyor.
- [ ] Convert over the docs somehow? Can't submodule hugo :(
