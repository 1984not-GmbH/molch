## Purpose of this library

Outcome is a C++14 library for reporting and handling function failures. It can be used as a substitute for, or a complement to, the exception handling mechanism.

One use case is for contexts where using C++ exception handling is unsuitable for different reasons:

 * The high relative cost of throwing and catching a C++ exception.
 * Making some or all control paths explicitly detailed to aid code correctness auditing, as opposed to having hidden control paths caused by exceptions potentially thrown from any place.
 * Company policy to compile with exceptions disabled.
 * Maintaining a code base that was never designed with exception-safety in mind.
 * Parts of the programs/frameworks that themselves implement exception handling and cannot afford to use exceptions, like propagating failure reports across threads, tasks, fibersâ€¦


## Usage as a single header file

Outcome v2 comes in single header file form. This is regenerated per commit. To fetch
on Linux:

```
wget https://github.com/ned14/outcome/raw/develop/single-header/outcome.hpp
```

On BSD and OS X:

```
fetch https://github.com/ned14/outcome/raw/develop/single-header/outcome.hpp
```

On Windows, simply download the raw file from above and place it wherever it suits you.

## Pre Boost entry todo:

 - [x] Raise ABI compliance checker on CI.
 - [ ] Fix up the .natvis file, and permanently solve the permuting SHA issue.
 - [ ] Fix up the C interface to use `status_code`.
